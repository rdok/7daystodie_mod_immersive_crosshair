## Installation

- **Game Version:** Works with version 1.0 of the game.
- **Install with Vortex:** Use the [Vortex Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) to install the mod easily.
- **Optional Customization:**
  - For more in-game options, you can install the [Gears](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/4017) and [Quartz](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/2409/) mods.
  - You can also customize the mod manually by editing the `ModSettings.xml` file.



## Features
- The crosshair appears only when needed:
  - It shows up when you're holding a tool, using your hands, or hovering over an interactable object.
  - It automatically appears when an interaction prompt is available (like opening doors or interacting with cars), no matter what you have equipped.
- You can customize how the crosshair behaves in different situations:
  - **Bows (no sights):** Choose between turning the crosshair off or having it stay on.
  - **Tools and hands:** Choose to have the crosshair off, on only when needed, or always on.
  - **Melee weapons:** Choose to turn the crosshair off, have it appear dynamically, or keep it on all the time.
  - **Ranged weapons:** You can turn the crosshair off or keep it on.
- The mod uses the game's built-in system to detect how close you are to objects, ensuring the crosshair behaves accurately.
- Itâ€™s also compatible with the [Dot Crosshair](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5640) mod if you want a simpler crosshair option.
